## My Katas

This repository serves as a showcase for my completed CodeWars katas. CodeWars is an online platform that provides coding challenges (katas) to help improve programming skills. 
In this repository, you will find my solutions to various katas, demonstrating my problem-solving abilities.

### Repository Structure
The repository has the following structure:

#### Solutions:
<pre><code>
└── src
    └── main
        └── java
            └── com
                └── codecool
                    └── kataDirectory
                        └── KataSolution.java
                        └── KataDescription.md
</code></pre>

#### Tests:
<pre><code>
└── src
    └── test
        └── java
            └── com
                └── codecool
                    └── kataDirectory
                    |    └── KataTest.java
                    └── KataTest.java   
</code></pre>

Each kata is organized in its own directory, with a solution file containing my code.

## Getting Started
